# Shortest Job First (SJF)

<SimulatorButton algorithm="sjf" />

## Overview

SJF selects the process with the smallest burst time (execution time) to run next. This algorithm prioritizes shorter jobs to minimize the average waiting time across all processes.

## How It Works

1. Processes are ordered based on their predicted CPU burst time
2. The process with the shortest burst time is selected for execution
3. Can be implemented in two variants:
   - Non-preemptive SJF: Once a process starts, it runs to completion
   - Preemptive SJF (SRTF - Shortest Remaining Time First): Current process may be preempted if a new process arrives with shorter burst time

## Characteristics

- Optimal for minimizing average waiting time (when all processes arrive simultaneously)
- Potential for starvation of longer processes if short processes continuously arrive
- Requires prediction of burst time (often based on historical data)
- Better overall system throughput compared to FCFS

## SJF vs. SRTF: Key Differences

### Non-preemptive SJF
- Once a process begins execution, it runs until completion
- Easier to implement and has less overhead
- Not as responsive to new short processes arriving

### Preemptive SJF (SRTF)
- Currently running process can be interrupted if a shorter process arrives
- More responsive but introduces overhead from additional context switches
- Provides better average waiting time but may delay longer processes even more

## Burst Time Prediction

A major challenge in SJF is predicting burst times. Common approaches include:

1. **Exponential Averaging**: Uses the formula `tn+1 = α × actual_tn + (1-α) × predicted_tn` where α is a weighting factor between 0 and 1
2. **Process History**: Using historical data from previous executions of the same process
3. **Process Type Classification**: Categorizing processes by type and using typical burst times for each category

## When to Use SJF

SJF is particularly useful in:
- Batch processing environments where job lengths are known or can be estimated
- Systems where minimizing average waiting time is a priority
- Scenarios where process burst times vary significantly
- Environments where longer jobs can tolerate some additional delay

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages
- Provides minimum average waiting time among all scheduling algorithms
- Maximizes throughput by completing more short processes quickly
- Works well when burst times are known or accurately predictable

### Disadvantages
- Can lead to starvation of longer processes
- Requires advance knowledge or prediction of burst times
- Not ideal for interactive systems where response time is critical
- More complex to implement than FCFS
