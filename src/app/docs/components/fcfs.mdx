# First Come First Serve (FCFS)

<SimulatorButton algorithm="fcfs" />

## Overview

FCFS is the simplest CPU scheduling algorithm that schedules processes in the order they arrive in the ready queue. It follows the principle of "first-come, first-served," similar to how a queue works in real life.

## How It Works

1. Processes are executed strictly in the order they enter the ready queue
2. Non-preemptive: once a process starts executing, it continues until completion or until it performs an I/O operation
3. Implements a standard FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queue data structure

## Characteristics

- Simple to implement and understand
- Fair in the sense that processes are executed in arrival order
- Can suffer from "convoy effect" where short processes wait behind long processes
- No starvation as every process will eventually execute
- Average waiting time can be high if processes with long burst times arrive early

## The Convoy Effect

The convoy effect is a significant drawback of FCFS. This occurs when shorter processes are forced to wait for a longer process to complete execution. This situation can significantly increase the average waiting time across all processes and reduce overall system efficiency.

## When to Use FCFS

FCFS works best in environments where:
- Process burst times are roughly similar
- Simplicity of implementation is more important than performance optimization
- The system prioritizes fairness in terms of arrival order
- Processes are primarily batch jobs rather than interactive tasks

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages
- Simple to understand and implement
- No complex calculations or predictions required
- Fair based on arrival time
- No indefinite postponement of any process

### Disadvantages
- Not optimal for time-sharing systems
- Not suitable for interactive environments where quick response is critical
- Poor average waiting time when process burst times vary significantly
- CPU utilization can be lower than with other algorithms
